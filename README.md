# pirate_game
A game created by myself, I am the only developer. I will be open-sourcing all the gameâ€™s logic.

Hello, I am William Stigall the developer of this game.
The title is to be determined, but this is a text-adventure game in which it simulates the life of a
Pirate captain on the high seas. Most of the game's programming is going to be done with python.
Since this is a browser game, all the game's programming cannot be in python therefore, I will be going into
slightly unknown territory for the front-end part of this project.
This game isn't meant to be an ambitious project; it is a game with the purpose of creating meaningful experience for myself
